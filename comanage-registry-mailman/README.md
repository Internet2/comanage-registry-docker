# GNU Mailman 3 for COmanage Registry Docker

## What it is
Docker version of [GNU Mailman 3](http://www.list.org/) for use with
[COmanage Registry](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Home).

The instructions below detail how to build and then run a suite of 
services to deploy GNU Mailman 3 for use with a separate COmanage Registry
deployment. The suite of services include:

1. **mailman-core**: GNU Mailman 3 core services including the REST API server.

1. **mailman-web**: GNU Mailman 3 web interface.

1. **database**: Relational database, currently PostgreSQL, required by GNU Mailman 3.

1. **postfix**: MTA needed for sending and receiving mail.

1. **apache**: Apache HTTP Server with Shibboleth SP as a web proxy for GNU Mailman 3 REST and web interface.

## How To

* Install Docker. These instructions require version 17.03.1 or higher.

* The instructions below assume you are deploying the service stack using either Docker Swarm
or [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If you are deploying using Docker Compose then
install the Docker Compose script. These instructions require version 1.13.0 or higher.

* Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Internet2/comanage-registry-docker.git
cd comanage-registry-docker
```

* Build and tag the images used for each of the services
(you may use your own repository instead of "sphericalcowgroup")

```
pushd comanage-registry-mailman/core
docker build -t sphericalcowgroup/mailman-core:0.2.1 .
popd

pushd comanage-registry-mailman/web
docker build -t sphericalcowgroup/mailman-web:0.2.1 .
popd

pushd comanage-registry-mailman/apache-shib
docker build -t sphericalcowgroup/mailman-core-apache-shib .
popd

pushd comanage-registry-mailman/postfix
docker build -t sphericalcowgroup/mailman-postfix .
popd

```

* Gather or create the following secrets and other information to be injected (be sure
to substitute your own secrets and do not use the examples below):

  * A password for the PostgreSQL user, eg. `gECPnaqXVID80TlRS5ZG`.

  * An API key for GNU Mailman 3 Hyperkitty (web front end), eg. `HbTKLdrhRxUX96f5bD2g`.

  * A secret key used by Django for signing cookies, eg. `fPe7d9e0PKF8ryySOow0`.

  * A password for the GNU Mailman 3 REST user, eg. `K6gfcC9uHQMXr448Kmdi`.

  * An X.509 certificate for HTTPS for Apache HTTP Server (Apache). The server certificate and any subordinate
CA signing certificates (except for the trust root) should be in a single file, eg. `fullchain.pem`.

  * The associated private key for the X.509 HTTPS certificate, eg. `privkey.pem`.

* Create the directory structure on the Docker engine hosts needed for the services 
to save local state, eg.

```
mkdir -p /srv/docker/opt/mailman/core
mkdir -p /srv/docker/opt/mailman/web
mkdir -p /srv/docker/opt/mailman/database
mkdir -p /srv/docker/opt/mailman/shib
```

* If you are using Docker Compose to deploy the service stack copy the file
`docker-compose.yaml`. Review the services configuration. You MUST make at least the following
changes (some environment variables are set for more than one service):

  * `MAILMAN_DATABASE_URL`: URL of the form `postgres://mailman:PASSWORD@database/mailmandb` where `PASSWORD` is the 
  password for the PostgreSQL database.

  * `HYPERKITT_API_KEY`: API key for GNU Mailman 3 Hyperkitty (web front end)

  * `MAILMAN_REST_PASSWORD`: A password for the GNU Mailman 3 REST user

  * `SERVE_FROM_DOMAIN`: The domain name from which Django (web front end) will be served.

  * `MAILMAN_ADMIN_EMAIL`: The email address of the first GNU Mailman 3 administrator.

  * `MAILMAN_WEB_SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used by Django for signing cookies.

  * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The PostgreSQL database password.

  * `POSTFIX_MAILNAME`: The domain name from which Postfix will be receiving and sending mail.

  * Copy the Nginx X.509 certificate chain file, private key, and DH param files and edit the
  `volumes` for the `ngnix` service as necessary to mount the files into the container.

* If you are using Docker Swarm to deploy the service stack copy the file `mailman-stack.yml`.
Review the services configuration. Create the necessary Swarm secrets, eg.

```
echo "postgres://mailman:gECPnaqXVID80TlRS5ZG@database/mailmandb" | docker secret create mailman_database_url -
echo "HbTKLdrhRxUX96f5bD2g" | docker secret create hyperkitty_api_key -
echo "K6gfcC9uHQMXr448Kmdi" | docker secret create mailman_rest_password -
echo "fPe7d9e0PKF8ryySOow0" | docker secret create mailman_web_secret_key -
echo "gECPnaqXVID80TlRS5ZG" | docker secret create postgres_password -
docker secret create https_cert_file fullchain.pem
docker secret create https_key_file privkey.pem
```

Additionally you MUST also make at least the following changes to the stack compose file `mailman-stack.yml`:

  * `MAILMAN_ADMIN_EMAIL`: The email address of the first GNU Mailman 3 administrator.

  * `POSTFIX_MAILNAME`: The domain name from which Postfix will be receiving and sending mail.

* Start the services. If you are using Docker Compose then run

```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you are using Docker Swarm then run

```
docker stack deploy --compose-file mailman-stack.yml mailman
```

* It can take as long as 30 seconds for the GNU Mailman 3 core service to be ready. The other
services wait until detecting that core is ready. Monitor the `apache` service with

```
docker-compose logs -f --tail=100 apache
```

or

```
docker service logs --tail=100 -f mailman_apache
```

until Apache is ready. You should see something like

```

```

* Browse to port 443 on the host and authenticate using an identity provider (IdP) federated
with the Shibboleth SP.

* Visit the [COmanage wiki](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Mailman+Provisioning+Plugin)

```
docker-compose down
```

or

```
docker stack rm mailman
```
