# Evaluating COmanage Registry using Docker

Follow these steps to build and run a simple deployment of COmanage Registry
suitable for evaluation purposes.

* Install Docker. These instructions require version 17.05 or higher.

* Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). These instructions require 
version 1.13.0 or higher.

* Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Internet2/comanage-registry-docker.git
cd comanage-registry-docker
```

* Define the shell variable `COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION` to be the version
of COmanage Registry you want to deploy. See the
[COmanage Registry Release History](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Release+History)
wiki page for the list of releases. We recommend using the latest release.

Here is an example (but please check the wiki page for the latest release number):

```
export COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION=3.2.1
```

* Build the base COmanage Registry image:

```
pushd comanage-registry-base
docker build \
    --build-arg COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION=${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION} \
    -t comanage-registry-base:${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION}-1 .
popd
```

* Build an image for COmanage Registry that uses basic authentication:

```
pushd comanage-registry-basic-auth
docker build \
    --build-arg COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION=${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION} \
    -t comanage-registry:${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION}-basic-auth .
popd
```

* Build a local image of PostgreSQL for COmanage Registry:

```
pushd comanage-registry-postgres
docker build -t comanage-registry-postgres .
popd
```

* Create a docker-compose.yml file:

```
version: '3.1'

services:

    comanage-registry-database:
        image: comanage-registry-postgres

    comanage-registry:
        image: "comanage-registry:${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION}-basic-auth"
        ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
```

* Start the services:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

* Browse to port 443 on the host, for example `https://localhost/`. You will have to
  click through the warning from your browser about the self-signed certificate used
  for HTTPS.

* Click `Login` and when prompted enter `registry.admin` as the username and `password`
for the password. 

* Visit the [COmanage wiki](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Setting+Up+Your+First+CO)
to learn how to create your first collaborative organization (CO) and begin using
the platform.

* To stop the services:
```
docker-compose stop
```

* To remove the containers and networks:
```
docker-compose down
```

### Important Notes
The instructions above are *not suitable for a production deployment* for two reasons:

1. The deployed services use default and easily guessed passwords.
2. No data is persisted. When the containers are destroyed so is your data.

## Next Steps
To evolve your COmanage Registry deployment examine the documentation
in the [docs directory](./README.md).
