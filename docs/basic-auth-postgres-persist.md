# COmanage Registry Docker
## With Basic Authentication, PostgreSQL, and persisted data

* Define the shell variable `COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION` to be the version
of COmanage Registry you want to deploy. See the
[COmanage Registry Release History](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Release+History)
wiki page for the list of releases. We recommend using the latest release.

Here is an example (but please check the wiki page for the latest release number):

```
export COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION=3.1.1
```

* Build a local image for COmanage Registry if you have not already:

```
pushd comanage-registry-basic-auth
sed -e s/%%COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION%%/${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION}/g Dockerfile.template  > Dockerfile
docker build -t comanage-registry:${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION}-basic-auth .
popd
```

* Build a local image of PostgreSQL for COmanage Registry if you have not already:
```
pushd comanage-registry-postgres
docker build -t comanage-registry-postgres .
popd
```

* Create directories to persist the relational database and COmanage Registry
local configuration:
```
mkdir -p /docker/var/lib/postgresql/data
mkdir -p /docker/srv/comanage-registry/local
```

* Create a template docker-compose.yml file that mounts the directories you created
as volumes in the database container:
```
version: '3.1'

services:

    comanage-registry-database:
        image: comanage-registry-postgres
        volumes:
            - /docker/var/lib/postgresql/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

    comanage-registry:
        image: comanage-registry:COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION-basic-auth
        volumes:
            - /docker/srv/comanage-registry/local:/srv/comanage-registry/local
        ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
```

* Use sed to set the COmanage Registry version for the image in the 
docker-compose.yml file:

```
sed -i s/COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION/$COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION/ docker-compose.yml
```

* Start the services:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

* Browse to port 443 on the host, for example `https://localhost/`

* Click `Login` and when prompted enter `registry.admin` as the username and `password`
for the password. See [Advanced Configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) 
for details on setting a non-default administrator username and
password.

* Visit the [COmanage wiki](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Setting+Up+Your+First+CO)
to learn how to create your first collaborative organization (CO) and begin using
the platform.

* To stop the services:
```
docker-compose stop
```

* To remove the containers and networks:
```
docker-compose down
```

Even though the containers have been removed the data is persisted. You may
bring up the services again and resume where you left off.

### Important Notes
The instructions above are *not suitable for a production deployment* 
because the deployed services use default and easily guessed passwords.

See [Advanced Configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) 
for details on setting a non-default administrator username and password.
