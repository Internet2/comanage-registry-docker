# Environment Variables Common to All Images

The environment variables detailed below apply to all COmanage
Registry images in this repository.

## Using Files to Inject Secrets

The COmanage Registry images support the convention of an associated
environment variable ending with ```_FILE``` to indicate a path
relative to the container from which the value for an environment
variable should be read.

For example if the environment variable ```COMANAGE_REGISTRY_DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD_FILE```
exists and its value is the path to a readable file, then the contents of the
file will be read into the environment variable ```COMANAGE_REGISTRY_DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD```.

If both an environment variable and the associated ```_FILE``` environment variable
are defined the associated ```_FILE``` environment variable takes precedence, 
provided that the file it points to exists and is readable.
