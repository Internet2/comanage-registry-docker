# Simple Development Sandbox

Follow these steps to build and run a simple deployment of COmanage Registry
suitable for beginning COmanage Registry development.

* Complete all of the steps in 
[Evaluating COmanage Registry using Docker](evaluation.md). Make sure you can
log into COmanage Registry but do not save any changes. Be sure to run
`docker compose down` so that no containers are left running.

* Create a directory somewhere to save the state of the COmanage Registry
database. For example, on Linux

```
sudo mkdir -p /srv/docker/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

On Mac OS you might instead do something like

```
mkdir -p $HOME/comanage-data/postgresql/data
```

* Clone the COmanage Registry repository somewhere, for example

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/Internet2/comanage-registry.git
```

* Change directories into the repository you just
cloned and create some necessary files and set appropriate permissions:

```
cd comanage-registry
cp -a app/tmp.dist local/tmp
chmod -R o+rw local/tmp
```

* Tell git to ignore changes the container makes during startup:

```
git update-index --assume-unchanged app/Config/bootstrap.php
```

* Checkout the develop branch or any other branch you want to work
from (you probably do not want to work from master):

```
git checkout develop
```

* Edit the docker-compose.yml file you used previously and add three
volume bind mounts:
  
  1. One volume will mount the directory you created in the above
     step for saving the database state to the directory
     `/var/lib/postgresql/data` inside the database container.
  1. A second volume will mount the `app` directory from the COmanage
     Registry repository clone you created to the
     `/srv/comanage-registry/app` directory inside the 
     COmanage Registry container.
  1. The third volume will mount the `local` directory from the
     COmanage Registry repository clone to the
     `/srv/comanage-registry/local` directory inside the COmanage
     Registry container.

Below is an example. The details will depend where you create the
database state directory and the repository clone. Be sure to
adjust the volume mounts for your deployment.

```
version: '3.1'

services:

    comanage-registry-database:
        image: comanage-registry-postgres
        volumes:
            - /srv/docker/var/lib/postgresql/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

    comanage-registry:
        image: "comanage-registry:${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION}-basic-auth"
        volumes:
            - /home/skoranda/comanage-registry/app:/srv/comanage-registry/app
            - /home/skoranda/comanage-registry/local:/srv/comanage-registry/local

        ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
```

* Make sure the shell variable `COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION` is still
set (see [Evaluating COmanage Registry using Docker](evaluation.md).)

* Start the services:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

* Browse to port 443 on the host, for example `https://localhost/`. You will have to
  click through the warning from your browser about the self-signed certificate used
  for HTTPS.

* Click `Login` and when prompted enter `registry.admin` as the username and `password`
for the password. 

* Visit the [COmanage Developer Manual](https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/x/FYDVCQ) for
tips and suggestions as well as the [COmanage Coding Style](https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/x/l6_KAQ).

* To stop the services:
```
docker-compose stop
```

* To remove the containers and networks:
```
docker-compose down
```

### Adding more test users

The simple development sandbox uses 
[standard HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication),
and in particular the 
[Apache HTTP Server implementation of basic authentication](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/auth.html).
The default user is `registry.admin` and the default password is `password`.

To add more test users begin by copying the default basic authentication file
from a running container to your file system, for example

```
docker cp comanage-registry:/etc/apache2/basic-auth ./basic-auth
```

Move that file to somewhere on your filesystem where you can use it as another
bind-mount volume for the COmanage Registry container, for example

```
mkdir -p /srv/docker/etc/apache2/
cp basic-auth /srv/docker/etc/apache2/basic-auth
```

Edit the docker-compose file and add the bind-mount for the `comanage-registry`
service, for example

```
volume:
    - /srv/docker/etc/apache2/basic-auth:/etc/apache2/basic-auth
```

Edit the basic-auth file using the `htpasswd` command. For example
to add the user `skoranda` run

```
htpasswd /srv/docker/etc/apache2/basic-auth skoranda
```

Restart the services and you can now authenticate to COmanage Registry
using the username and password combination you added to the password
file.

Note that an authentication module used in production, like the 
Shibboleth Service Provider (SP), often sets the "username" to a
more sophisticated value. For example, if the Shibboleth SP is configured
to consume eduPersonPrincipalName (ePPN) and populate that into
`REMOTE_USER` then the "username" might be a value like
`scott.koranda@uwm.edu`. 

You can mock up the same behavior by simply adding the "username"
`scott.koranda@uwm.edu` with a password using the above technique.

### Mocking Apache CGI environment variables

Some COmanage Registry functionality, such as the
[Env Source](https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/x/swr9Bg)
Organizational Identity Source, requires that the Apache HTTP Server
set Apache CGI environment variables. These environment variables are
usually set by more sophisticated authentication modules like the
Shibboleth (SP). You can mock up the same 
behavior using the
[SetEnv](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_env.html)
directive for Apache.

To mock up an environment variable begin by copying the default Apache
configuration file from a running container to your file system, for example

```
docker cp comanage-registry:/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-comanage.conf ./000-comanage.conf
```

Move that file to somewhere on your filesystem where you can use it as another
bind-mount volume for the COmanage Registry container, for example

```
mkdir -p /srv/docker/etc/apache2/
cp basic-auth /srv/docker/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-comanage.conf
```

Edit the docker-compose file and add the bind-mount for the `comanage-registry`
service, for example

```
volume:
    - /srv/docker/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-comanage.conf:/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-comanage.conf
```

Edit the `000-comanage.conf` file and add a `SetEnv` directive, for example

```
SetEnv ENV_OIS_NAME_GIVEN Scott
SetEnv ENV_OIS_NAME_FAMILY Koranda
SetEnv ENV_OIS_MAIL skoranda@gmail.com
SetEnv ENV_OIS_EPPN scott.koranda@sphericalcowgroup.com
```

Restart the services and authenticate to COmanage Registry.
After authenticating COmanage Registry should "see" those
environment variables defined for the authenticated user.


### Important Notes
The instructions above are *not suitable for a production deployment* 
since the deployed services use default and easily guessed passwords.
