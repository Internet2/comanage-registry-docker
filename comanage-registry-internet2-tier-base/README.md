# COmanage Registry Internet2 TIER Base Image

Intended to build a COmanage Registry for Internet2 TIER base image
using CentOS 7 as the operating system and building PHP from source.

By itself the image built from this Dockerfile does **not** provide
COmanage Registry.

The image built from this Dockerfile is used as the base
for the Internet2 TIER image that includes COmanage Registry
with the Shibboleth Native SP for Apache HTTP Server (Shibboleth)
as the authentication mechanism.
