# COmanage Registry Docker

## What it is
Docker version of [COmanage
Registry](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Home).

COmanage Registry is a web application that requires a relational database
and an authentication mechanism such as 
[Shibboleth](http://shibboleth.net/products/service-provider.html), 
[SimpleSAMLphp](https://simplesamlphp.org/), 
[mod_auth_openidc](https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc),
or just simple [Basic Authentication](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_auth_basic.html).
Since COmanage Registry itself is agnostic about the database and authentication
mechanism used this repository includes multiple Dockerfiles to build images that use various
combinations of tools.

## How To

* Install Docker. These instructions require version 17.03.1 or higher.

* Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). These instructions require 
version 1.13.0 or higher.

* Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Internet2/comanage-registry-docker.git
cd comanage-registry-docker
```

* Define the shell variable `COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION` to be the version
of COmanage Registry you want to deploy. See the
[COmanage Registry Release History](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Release+History)
wiki page for the list of releases. We recommend using the latest release.

Here is an example (but please check the wiki page for the latest release number):

```
export COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION=3.1.1
```

* Build a local image for COmanage Registry:

```
pushd comanage-registry-basic-auth
sed -e s/%%COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION%%/${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION}/g Dockerfile.template  > Dockerfile
docker build -t comanage-registry:${COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION}-basic-auth .
popd
```

* Build a local image of PostgreSQL for COmanage Registry:
```
pushd comanage-registry-postgres
docker build -t comanage-registry-postgres .
popd
```
* Create a template docker-compose.yml file:
```
version: '3.1'

services:

    comanage-registry-database:
        image: comanage-registry-postgres

    comanage-registry:
        image: comanage-registry:COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION-basic-auth
        ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
```

* Use sed to set the COmanage Registry version for the image in the 
docker-compose.yml file:

```
sed -i s/COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION/$COMANAGE_REGISTRY_VERSION/ docker-compose.yml
```

* Start the services:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

* Browse to port 443 on the host, for example `https://localhost/`. You will have to
  click through the warning from your browser about the self-signed certificate used
  for HTTPS.

* Click `Login` and when prompted enter `registry.admin` as the username and `password`
for the password. 

See [Advanced Configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) 
for details on setting a non-default administrator username and password.

* Visit the [COmanage wiki](https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Setting+Up+Your+First+CO)
to learn how to create your first collaborative organization (CO) and begin using
the platform.

* To stop the services:
```
docker-compose stop
```

* To remove the containers and networks:
```
docker-compose down
```

### Important Notes
The instructions above are *not suitable for a production deployment* for two reasons:

1. The deployed services use default and easily guessed passwords.
2. No data is persisted. When the containers are destroyed so is your data.

## Next Steps
To evolve your COmanage Registry deployment examine the documentation
in the [docs directory](docs/README.md) or follow these direct links:

* [Persist data using host-mounted volumes](docs/basic-auth-postgres-persist.md)
* [Use MariaDB instead of PostgreSQL](docs/basic-auth-mariadb-persist.md)
* [Add OpenLDAP slapd for provisioning](docs/openldap-slapd.md)
* [Advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md)
* [Complete example recipe for production deployment](docs/shibboleth-sp-postgres-compose.md)
* [Using Docker service stacks and Docker secrets](docs/mod-auth-oidc-mariadb-stacks.md)
